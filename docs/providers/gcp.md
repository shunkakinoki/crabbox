# Google Cloud Provider

Read this when you:

- choose `provider: gcp`;
- set up Compute Engine credentials for direct or brokered leases;
- debug GCP quota, machine types, firewall rules, labels, or cleanup;
- change `internal/providers/gcp`, `internal/cli/gcp.go`, or `worker/src/gcp.ts`.

Google Cloud is a managed SSH-lease provider for Linux Compute Engine VMs.
Crabbox provisions the instance, SSH metadata, labels, boot disk, public IP, and
a Crabbox-managed SSH firewall rule. Once the VM exists, the standard SSH path
owns readiness, sync, command execution, results, label touches, release, and
cleanup. GCP can run direct from the CLI (Application Default Credentials) or
brokered through the coordinator (`Coordinator: supported`).

## When to use

Use GCP when:

- your billing, quota, or compliance boundary already lives in Google Cloud;
- you want Linux Compute Engine capacity behind the shared coordinator;
- you want direct local testing with Google Application Default Credentials.

GCP is Linux-only. For Windows, WSL2, macOS, Linux desktop/browser/code leases,
or the AMI-style image bake-and-promote workflow, use AWS instead. GCP does
support [Tailscale](../features/tailscale.md) and native
[checkpoints](../features/checkpoints.md) (machine-image and disk-snapshot
fork/restore) — see below.

### Provider names

```text
gcp
google
google-cloud
```

`google` and `google-cloud` are aliases. Crabbox canonicalizes them to `gcp`
before direct or brokered lease requests, including class default selection.

## Quick start

Direct local smoke test:

```sh
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com --project example-project-123

export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=example-project-123
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json"

tmp="$(mktemp)"
trap 'rm -f "$tmp"' EXIT
printf 'provider: gcp\n' > "$tmp"
env -u CRABBOX_COORDINATOR -u CRABBOX_COORDINATOR_TOKEN \
  CRABBOX_CONFIG="$tmp" \
  crabbox run --provider gcp --type e2-micro --market on-demand --no-sync -- \
  echo gcp-ok
```

Normal class-based leases:

```sh
crabbox warmup --provider gcp --class standard
crabbox run --provider gcp --class fast -- pnpm test
crabbox ssh --provider gcp --id blue-lobster
crabbox stop --provider gcp blue-lobster
crabbox cleanup --provider gcp
```

`--type` is exact, for example `--type c4-standard-32` or `--type e2-micro`. Use
`--class` to let Crabbox retry the provider's class candidates.

## Configuration

```yaml
provider: gcp
target: linux
class: beast
gcp:
  project: example-project-123
  zone: europe-west2-a
  image: projects/ubuntu-os-cloud/global/images/family/ubuntu-2604-lts-amd64
  network: default
  subnet: ""
  tags:
    - crabbox-ssh
  sshCIDRs: []
  rootGB: 400
  serviceAccount: ""
```

Defaults applied when a field is unset: `zone` `europe-west2-a`, `network`
`default`, `tags` `[crabbox-ssh]`, `rootGB` `400`, and the Ubuntu 26.04 LTS image
above. `project` and `zone` are required for a direct lease.

Project resolution order is `CRABBOX_GCP_PROJECT`, then `gcp.project`, then
`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, then `GCP_PROJECT_ID`. Brokered requests forward only the
Crabbox-specific project sources (`CRABBOX_GCP_PROJECT` / `gcp.project`); ambient
ADC project variables (`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GCP_PROJECT_ID`) stay local so
the Worker's own defaults apply.

### Direct-mode environment

```text
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
GCP_PROJECT_ID
CRABBOX_GCP_PROJECT
CRABBOX_GCP_ZONE
CRABBOX_GCP_IMAGE
CRABBOX_GCP_NETWORK
CRABBOX_GCP_SUBNET
CRABBOX_GCP_TAGS
CRABBOX_GCP_SSH_CIDRS
CRABBOX_GCP_ROOT_GB
CRABBOX_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
```

### Capacity environment

```text
CRABBOX_CAPACITY_MARKET
CRABBOX_CAPACITY_FALLBACK
CRABBOX_CAPACITY_AVAILABILITY_ZONES
```

`capacity.availabilityZones` controls GCP zone fallback. `capacity.regions` does
not expand into zones for GCP today.

## Direct auth

Direct mode uses Google's official Compute Go SDK
(`cloud.google.com/go/compute/apiv1`) and the credential sources supported by
Google Application Default Credentials.

Local setup:

```sh
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud auth list
gcloud auth application-default print-access-token >/dev/null
```

Project setup:

```sh
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com --project example-project-123
gcloud compute zones list --project example-project-123 --filter='name=europe-west2-a'
```

Common blockers:

- Compute Engine API disabled — enable `compute.googleapis.com`.
- Billing disabled — attach billing before enabling Compute.
- Missing IAM — the active account needs enough Compute permissions to create,
  label, list, and delete instances, plus permission to manage the shared
  firewall rule.
- Service Usage denied — the account may still run Compute calls but cannot list
  or enable APIs.

For a cheap live smoke test, use
`--type e2-micro --market on-demand --no-sync --ttl 20m --idle-timeout 5m`. This
exercises instance creation, SSH metadata, cloud-init, SSH readiness, command
execution, and release/delete without syncing a repository.

## Brokered auth

Brokered mode uses coordinator-side Google credentials, so developer machines
do not need Google credentials when the coordinator owns provisioning. The
coordinator uses Compute REST calls and lists pool state through aggregated
instance listing with partial success enabled, so one unhealthy zone does not
hide healthy Crabbox VMs elsewhere.

The coordinator always needs a project:

```text
GCP_PROJECT_ID   (or CRABBOX_GCP_PROJECT)
```

For a coordinator running on Google Cloud infrastructure, prefer the attached
service account identity. GKE Workload Identity, Compute Engine, and similar
Google-hosted runtimes can provide short-lived tokens through the metadata
server, so no service-account private key is required in the coordinator
environment. Enable this credential source explicitly:

```text
CRABBOX_GCP_CREDENTIAL_SOURCE=metadata
```

The attached service account still needs the IAM permissions used by the
coordinator. On Compute Engine, configure the VM with the
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` access scope; VM access scopes
cap the permissions available to metadata-issued tokens even when IAM grants
the service account broader roles.

For portable coordinator deployments without metadata server credentials, set
both service-account key variables:

```text
GCP_CLIENT_EMAIL
GCP_PRIVATE_KEY
```

If either `GCP_CLIENT_EMAIL` or `GCP_PRIVATE_KEY` is set, both must be set.
When `CRABBOX_GCP_CREDENTIAL_SOURCE` is unset, brokered GCP uses the
service-account-key path. `CRABBOX_GCP_CREDENTIAL_SOURCE=service-account-key`
is accepted as an explicit spelling of the same default. Metadata token requests
reject redirects and responses without Google's metadata marker, refresh before
the metadata server's five-minute token-cache boundary, and retry
connection/startup failures plus transient `429`, `499`, and `5xx` responses
with bounded exponential backoff and a one-minute overall deadline.

Optional coordinator defaults (same names as the direct-mode environment):

```text
CRABBOX_GCP_ZONE
CRABBOX_GCP_IMAGE
CRABBOX_GCP_NETWORK
CRABBOX_GCP_TAGS
CRABBOX_GCP_ROOT_GB
CRABBOX_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
CRABBOX_GCP_CREDENTIAL_SOURCE
```

Explicit broker requests for `gcp.project`, `gcp.image`, `gcp.network`,
`gcp.subnet`, `gcp.tags`, or `gcp.serviceAccount` require admin-token
authentication. Normal broker users receive the coordinator-managed values.
Direct mode keeps these local configuration overrides.

Verify configuration:

```sh
crabbox doctor --provider gcp
```

Maintainers can exercise the coordinator's exact ownership boundary against a
disposable `e2-micro`: set the project plus either coordinator credential path
above, then set `LIVE_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY`, then run
`CRABBOX_GCP_RELEASE_LIVE=1 npm test --prefix worker -- --run test/gcp-release.live.test.ts`.
The smoke proves a foreign owner claim is denied, the exact owner claim is
deleted, and neither the instance nor its boot disk remains.

The readiness check reports missing configuration names without exposing values.
Lease creation fails with `provider_not_configured` until the coordinator has a
project plus either a complete service-account key pair or
`CRABBOX_GCP_CREDENTIAL_SOURCE=metadata`.

## Lifecycle

1. Resolve project, zone, image, network, disk, tags, and credentials.
2. Ensure a Crabbox-managed SSH firewall exists for the configured network, SSH
   ports, CIDRs, and target tags.
3. Create a Compute Engine instance with Ubuntu cloud-init, SSH metadata
   (`enable-oslogin=FALSE`), and Crabbox labels.
4. Attach a service account when `gcp.serviceAccount` or
   `CRABBOX_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` is set.
5. For Spot leases, set scheduling to provisioning model `SPOT`, on-host
   maintenance `TERMINATE`, automatic restart off, and termination action
   `DELETE`.
6. Wait for the public IP, then for SSH and the Crabbox ready marker.
7. Touch labels during active runs.
8. Delete the VM on release unless the lease is kept.

## Machine classes

```text
tiny      c4-standard-4, c3-standard-4, n2-standard-4, n2d-standard-4
small     c4-standard-8, c3-standard-8, n2-standard-8, n2d-standard-8, c4-standard-4
standard  c4-standard-32, c3-standard-22, n2-standard-32, n2d-standard-32
fast      c4-standard-64, c3-standard-44, n2-standard-64, n2d-standard-64, c4-standard-32
large     c4-standard-96, c3-standard-88, n2-standard-80, n2d-standard-96, c4-standard-64
beast     c4-standard-192, c4-standard-96, c3-standard-176, c3-standard-88, n2d-standard-224, n2-standard-128
```

`capacity.market: spot` maps to GCP Spot VMs. If `capacity.fallback` starts with
`on-demand`, Crabbox retries the same zone and type candidates as on-demand after
retryable Spot capacity or quota failures.

Explicit `--type` disables class-candidate fallback. Zone fallback and
Spot-to-on-demand fallback still apply to the exact requested type when GCP
returns a quota, capacity, rate-limit, or unavailable-type error. See
[Capacity and fallback](../features/capacity-fallback.md).

## Networking

The provider uses `gcp.network` and optional `gcp.subnet`.

- If either value is a full self link, Crabbox uses it as-is.
- Otherwise `gcp.network` becomes `projects/<project>/global/networks/<name>`.
- Otherwise `gcp.subnet` becomes
  `projects/<project>/regions/<region>/subnetworks/<name>`, where the region is
  derived from the zone.

The default firewall allows SSH ingress from `0.0.0.0/0` when no CIDRs are
configured. Set `gcp.sshCIDRs` or `CRABBOX_GCP_SSH_CIDRS` for tighter ingress.
The default-network, default-policy rule is named `crabbox-ssh`; custom networks
use `crabbox-ssh-<network>`. Non-default CIDRs, tags, or SSH ports append a
policy-hash suffix so leases with different ingress settings do not rewrite each
other's SSH access.

Explicit `gcp.tags` or `CRABBOX_GCP_TAGS` replace the default target tags for
that lease; they are not merged with the default `crabbox-ssh` tag.

Crabbox refuses to update an existing firewall unless its description marks it as
Crabbox-managed. Rename the firewall, change tags, or adopt it intentionally if
an older rule already owns the name.

For Tailscale-meshed leases, see [Tailscale](../features/tailscale.md). Direct
`--tailscale` requires an auth key in the configured auth-key environment
variable; brokered mode uses coordinator OAuth secrets.

## Labels and cleanup

GCP labels must be lowercase and label keys must start with a letter. Crabbox
sanitizes keys separately from values so numeric lease metadata stays parseable.

Key cleanup labels:

```text
crabbox=true
provider=gcp
lease=<cbx_id>
state=ready
keep=false
created_at=<unix_seconds>
expires_at=<unix_seconds>
ttl_secs=<seconds>
zone=<gcp_zone>
```

Crabbox also records the immutable numeric Compute Engine instance ID in the
local lease claim. Direct release and cleanup require that unchanged claim to
match the exact project, zone, instance name and numeric ID, lease, slug, and
provider key before deletion. Labels and deterministic names remain discovery
hints, not destructive authority. Claimless or stale-claim resources are
skipped; recover or remove them through an explicit operator-controlled GCP
workflow instead of silently adopting cloud metadata.

Direct cleanup:

```sh
tmp="$(mktemp)"
trap 'rm -f "$tmp"' EXIT
printf 'provider: gcp\n' > "$tmp"

env -u CRABBOX_COORDINATOR -u CRABBOX_COORDINATOR_TOKEN \
  CRABBOX_CONFIG="$tmp" \
  crabbox cleanup --provider gcp --dry-run

env -u CRABBOX_COORDINATOR -u CRABBOX_COORDINATOR_TOKEN \
  CRABBOX_CONFIG="$tmp" \
  crabbox cleanup --provider gcp
```

Cleanup lists Crabbox-labeled instances across the project's visible zones using
aggregated instance listing with partial success enabled. Inventory accepts only
deterministically named instances with the canonical `crabbox`, `created_by`,
`provider`, and valid lease labels, then deletes expired or released leases in
the zone recorded on each VM. Brokered workspace recovery first resolves the
exact deterministic instance name in the lease's recorded project and zone. A
zonal miss falls back to cross-zone inventory for that exact name so interrupted
pre-upgrade fallback creates remain recoverable. Both paths check the same
canonical labels; neither adopts the first project-wide lease-label match, and
duplicate exact-name matches fail as ambiguous. These checks are
defense-in-depth against accidental or ambiguous resource adoption. GCP labels
are operator metadata, not an authorization boundary against another principal
that can already mutate instances in the same project. Brokered cleanup is
coordinator-owned; direct cleanup additionally requires the exact local claim
described above.

Three independent safety nets enforce expiry:

- Direct GCP VMs set Compute Engine `maxRunDuration` with termination action
  `DELETE`, so the TTL hard cap is enforced by the platform.
- Each VM installs a guest-side `crabbox-gcp-expiry-guard` systemd timer that
  reads live instance labels through the metadata service and Compute API, then
  self-deletes expired non-kept leases when the attached service account can
  delete the VM.
- Cleanup removes stale local GCP claim files whose lease IDs no longer appear in
  provider inventory.

See [Lifecycle and cleanup](../features/lifecycle-cleanup.md) for the shared model.

## Typed ready-pool provenance

Linux leases created from a boot image or disk snapshot record the exact
immutable numeric resource ID and source reference after Compute Engine accepts
the VM creation. Typed ready-pool identity uses the source namespace
`projects/<project>/global/images` or
`projects/<project>/global/snapshots`, the numeric ID, and the canonical
architecture. The execution project must also be recorded as launch evidence,
but it is not substituted for the source project and does not enter the
identity. The launch zone is excluded so capacity fallback does not split an
otherwise identical cohort.

Only relative resource names and the lowercase official Compute API HTTPS forms
are accepted. Family aliases, extra path segments, ports, queries, fragments,
percent-encoded ambiguity, kind/collection mismatches, and non-numeric IDs fail
closed. Machine images remain valid checkpoint sources but do not expose the
created boot disk provenance required for typed ready-pool reuse.

## Checkpoints

Brokered Linux GCP leases support native [checkpoints](../features/checkpoints.md):

- `--strategy image` captures a GCP machine image (`gcp-machine-image`).
- The default strategy captures a disk snapshot (`gcp-disk-snapshot`).

`checkpoint fork` and `checkpoint restore` rehydrate from either kind in the
recorded project and zone. Native checkpoints require a coordinator and a known
cloud instance ID; they are not available for direct-only leases.

New brokered GCP checkpoints are owned by the coordinator and manually retained
unless creation or `checkpoint policy` explicitly sets
`--expire-unused-after <duration>`. Ownership binds the exact project, global
resource kind/name, canonical resource ID, numeric immutable identity, and
source lease. Fork/shard use claims block expiry while provisioning is active.
Wrong-project, disabled-API, authorization, operation, or name-reuse failures
never count as successful deletion. Provider labels remain within GCP's
63-character value limit even when the coordinator checkpoint identifier is
long; a bounded ownership digest links those labels to the full durable ID.

Machine images remain valid checkpoint fork/restore sources, but Compute Engine
does not expose exact created-disk source evidence for them. They therefore
cannot supply typed ready-pool immutable provenance; use a boot image or disk
snapshot when that identity is required.

Generic `crabbox image delete <image-id> --provider gcp` refuses an image owned
by a managed checkpoint; use `checkpoint delete <id>` instead. GCP does not yet
have the AWS-style `image promote` bake pipeline. Direct and historical images
remain operator-managed.

## Troubleshooting

`Compute Engine API has not been used ... or it is disabled`

Enable the Compute API for the selected project:

```sh
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com --project example-project-123
```

`Billing account ... is not found`

Attach billing to the project before enabling Compute or creating instances.

`PERMISSION_DENIED` from Service Usage

The active account cannot enable or list APIs for the project. Use an account
with Service Usage permissions, or ask a project admin to enable Compute.

`get gcp firewall` or `create gcp firewall` fails

Check the network name, IAM, and whether a non-Crabbox firewall already owns the
`crabbox-ssh`, `crabbox-ssh-<network>`, or policy-suffixed firewall name.

SSH stays on port `22` and port `2222` never opens

Cloud-init may still be running. On very small instances, package update and
bootstrap can take several minutes. `crabbox run` falls back to SSH port `22`
when the configured port is not ready but the instance is otherwise reachable.

`crabbox cleanup --provider gcp` prints nothing

No expired Crabbox-labeled instances were found in the project zones visible to
the active credentials, or the command is still using the coordinator. Use a
temporary `CRABBOX_CONFIG` without broker settings for direct cleanup.

## Limitations

- Linux only — no GCP Windows, WSL2, or macOS.
- No desktop, browser, code-server, or VNC capabilities.
- No AWS-style image bake-and-promote pipeline (native checkpoints and
  `image delete` are supported).
- No provider pricing lookup yet; cost uses the generic managed-provider fallback
  rate.
- OS Login must not block metadata SSH keys. Crabbox sets `enable-oslogin=FALSE`
  on each instance; keep OS Login from being force-enabled at the project or org
  level until Crabbox grows an OS Login integration.
